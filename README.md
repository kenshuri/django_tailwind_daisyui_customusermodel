# Minimal template to set-up a Django project with TailwindCSS and daisyUI and a custom user model

Source code relative to my [blog post](https://blog.kenshuri.com/posts/003_define_custom_user.md) about adding a custom user model in Django.

## Set-up the project

To set-up the project from scratch, run the following commands in your terminal.

```shell
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Create a superuser as prompted. Note that it is asking you an email address and not a username like in the base model.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kenshuri/setup_django_tailwind_daisyui.git
cd setup_django_tailwind_daisyui
python -m virtualenv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd jstoolchains
npm install
```

You're good to go my friend!

## Start your project 

To see your project in action, open 2 terminals.

In the first terminal run:
```shell
cd setup_django_tailwind_daisyui
cd jstoolchains
npm run tailwind-watch
```

In the second terminal run:
```
cd setup_django_tailwind_daisyui
python manage.py runserver
```

As prompted, open the page http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and enjoy ðŸš€
